# Code

Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly!

```ts {all|2|1-6|all}
interface User {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  role: string
}

function updateUser(id: number, update: Partial<User>) {
  const user = getUser(id)

Title: ⚕️ Organ Matching 💜 and Donation System 🏥

Slide 1: 🌐 Introduction

📜 Topic: ⚕️ Organ Matching and Donation System

🎫 Objective: Develop an efficient framework for matching organ donors 🧑‍🦷 and recipients 🧑‍🦷 based on specific criteria, including blood type 💡, HLA matching, and urgency ⚡.

✅ Significance: Organ donation has the potential to save 🏥 countless lives; however, matching donors 🧑‍🦷 with recipients remains a complex task ❓ that requires sophisticated, real-time ⏳ data management 📊 strategies. This framework aims to address the limitations of current systems by introducing a comprehensive matching approach that optimizes both compatibility 💜 and urgency ⚡. The system ensures that data processing is performed with minimal delays, which is critical in life-saving scenarios ❤️.

Slide 2: 🎯 Challenges in Organ Donation

💨 Matching Complexity: Matching donors 🧑‍🦷 and recipients requires consideration of multiple factors, such as blood type 💡, HLA compatibility 🧬, and geographical proximity 🗽. Each of these factors presents unique challenges ❓, as blood type and HLA matching are non-negotiable biological requirements 🌈, while geographical proximity influences the practicality of transplant logistics ✈ and the likelihood of organ viability upon arrival ⏳.

🌐 Real-Time Requirements: Matches must be completed with minimal delay ⏳ to ensure timely transplants, necessitating efficient data processing 🛠️. The real-time requirement demands that all system components work in a synchronized manner ⏱ to minimize latency. Any delay in processing can result in missed opportunities 🚫 for successful transplantation 🧑‍🦷.

🛡 Healthcare Regulations: Compliance with stringent data security standards 🔒, including HIPAA, is essential to protect patient information 🧑‍🦷. Organ matching involves handling sensitive health data, and the system must ensure that all processes are compliant with legal standards 📏, thus safeguarding patient privacy 💔.

Slide 3: 🌐 System Design Overview

🏢 Architecture Requirements:

Rapid data retrieval 🗒️ to ensure that matching operations are conducted with minimal latency ⏳.

Real-time donor-recipient matching capabilities ⚕️, allowing for immediate response to available organ donations 🧑‍🦷.

Adherence to healthcare privacy regulations 🔒 to maintain compliance with legal standards such as HIPAA.

🛈 System Components:

📄 Donor and Recipient Registration: Incorporates privacy measures 🔒 to verify medical records 💻. This component ensures that all participants in the system are verified 🛠️, reducing the risk of fraud ⛔ or data inaccuracies.

📈 Matching Criteria: Utilizes data structures 🗒️ to prioritize recipients based on urgency ⚡, compatibility 💜, and geographical proximity 🗽. Matching criteria are dynamically assessed ⚛️ to ensure that the most urgent ⚡ cases are always prioritized.

Slide 4: 💻 Data Structures Employed

📱 Priority Queue:

Facilitates the management of recipient urgency levels ⚡. The system employs a priority queue to handle recipient listings 🗒️, ensuring that those with higher urgency receive priority in the matching process 🏥.

Time Complexity: Insertion and deletion operations are O(log n), allowing for efficient updates 🛠️ as new recipients are added or matched.

🤖 Hash Table:

Maps donors according to blood type 💡 for efficient lookup 🔎. This data structure ensures that searching for compatible donors is conducted in constant time ⏳.

Time Complexity: Constant time complexity, O(1), for retrieval operations 📈, crucial in maintaining real-time system performance ⏱.

🗒️ AVL Tree (Balanced Binary Tree):

Stores recipient data in a balanced manner 🚧 to ensure efficient operations ⚙️. AVL trees maintain balanced information on recipients, ensuring efficient data navigation and updates 🛠️.

Time Complexity: O(log n) for insertion and lookup, supporting rapid data modifications ⏳ while maintaining tree integrity.

🗺️ Graph Representation:

Implements Dijkstra's algorithm 🚀 to determine optimal geographic routes 🗽. Graph theory optimizes logistics of organ transport 🌐, ensuring each organ is routed through the fastest and most reliable path ⏱.

Time Complexity: O(log n) + O(V + E log V), effectively managing geographic data and determining the best transportation routes ✈.

Slide 5: 🛠️ Code Implementation

Recipient and Urgency Queue Example:

🤖 Explanation: Demonstrates how recipients are prioritized within the urgency queue ⚡ based on urgency levels. Higher urgency recipients are placed at the top 🏆 of the queue, ensuring the most critical ⚡ cases are addressed first.

Slide 6: 🛠️ Key Libraries Utilized

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing 🗒️. Essential for handling large datasets, cleaning data, and preparing it for subsequent operations, ensuring the information used in matching is accurate 🏥.

scikit-learn: Applied for potential machine learning models 🤖 to enhance matching accuracy ✅. Models can be trained to predict optimal matches based on historical data 📊.

SQLAlchemy: Facilitates database management 💻 and interactions. Interfaces with the backend database, providing an abstraction layer for data retrieval 🔎 and updates.

Geopy: Used for geographical computations 🗽, such as distance-based matching ✈. Ensures proximity 🛣️ is factored into matching criteria.

Slide 7: 💪 Potential Challenges

Scalability: Addressing hash table collisions 🔎 and ensuring efficient lookups 💻 for large datasets 📊. As the number of donors and recipients grows 🚀, ensuring hash table efficiency is a significant challenge ❓.

Geographical Limitations: Employing AI models 🤖 for routing across diverse 🗽 regions. Advanced AI routing models must account for real-time traffic 🚗 and regional limitations 🌐.

Real-Time Updates: Efficiently managing real-time data ⏳ without excessive computational overhead 🚨. The system must rapidly integrate new donor 🧑‍🦷 and recipient data ⚕️ while ensuring current matches are updated.

Compliance Issues: Navigating evolving healthcare data security 🔒 regulations. Compliance requires system flexibility to adapt to new legal requirements 📏.

Slide 8: 🛠️ Proposed Solutions and Future Steps

Modular Design: Each system component 🔧 has clear boundaries to facilitate modification ✏️ and expansion. This modular approach allows for improvements without affecting overall functionality 🛠️.

Advanced Matching Algorithms: Incorporate machine learning 🤖 to refine matching efficiency 🏥. Machine learning enhances the system’s ability to make nuanced matching decisions, improving success rates 🏆.

User Interface Development: Design a user-friendly 💻 interface to simplify interactions ⚙️. A well-designed UI is essential for medical personnel ⚕️ to efficiently interact with the system.

Testing and Validation: Comprehensive testing 🔢 ensures scalability and robustness. Testing will include unit tests ⚙️, integration tests 🛠️, and user acceptance tests 💻.

Slide 9: 🛠️ Next Phase - Optimization and Scaling

Data Structure Optimization: Implement caching 🤖 to enhance performance of frequently accessed profiles 🛠️. Caching frequently used data reduces retrieval time ⏱, improving response times ⏳.

Scaling Strategies: Modify system to manage larger datasets 📈 efficiently. Optimize storage methods 🗒️ and use distributed databases 💻 for increasing data volumes 🚀.

Advanced Testing Procedures: Introduce stress testing 🛠️ to evaluate robustness under various conditions ⚙️. Simulate high-load scenarios to ensure stability ⏱.

Final Evaluation: Compare the final implementation with the initial prototype 📝 to assess improvements 🛠️ and identify areas for development ✍️.
